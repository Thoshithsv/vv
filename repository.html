    <h3>I CALL TRUST AS "VACHAN" AND "VIBHA PURE"
    USUALLY I DONT CREATE ANY KIND OF EMOTIONS ON PEOPLES..STILL I DONT KNOW WHY I LOVE N LIKE THOSE PERSONALITIES 
    DELIVERED BY THESE PEOPLE.
    MET MANY PEOPLES STILL..THEY ARE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THESE IDIOTS USED TO LOVE AND CARE ME LIKE 
    NOBODY USED TO TREAT ME LIKE THAT BEFORE.
    UNFORTUNATELY THEY WRE TOO UNLUCKY IN DESERVING SUCH A MAD N HECTIC MAN.
    ME WITH METAL UNSTABILITY,I USED TO FIGHT WITH THEM WHICH WAS OF NO REASON.
    THEY ARE STILL BARING THIS IDOTIC BEHAVIOR..
    I REGRET EVERYDAY FOR HURRTING THEM SO OFTEN IN THOSE DAYS  WHICH THEY SPENT WITH ME.
    I THAUGHT ME THAT I AM THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE FOR SHORT TEMPERED BUT ACTUALLY I GOT KNOW THAT 
    WHO WAS ACTUALLY A SHORT TEMPERRED GUYS.
    I LITERALLY  MISS THOSE DAYS WHERE I USED TO TEXT THEM EVERY MORNING ANDD EVENING THOSE MESSAGE THAT WAS MY ROUTINE AND A WISH FROM
    GODDES WHO CAME AS A DEAR OF MINE I CALL HER AS "ODDI" AND EVEN SHE CALL ME AS "ODDUS".
